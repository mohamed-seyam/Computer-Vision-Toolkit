# Computer-Vision-Toolkit
this is repo contain implementations of most of computer vision algorithms


## implemenations of :
  - noise function to add noise to an image 
        - uniform noise, Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise 
  - filter function to filter noisy images (low pass filters) 
        - Average filter, Gaussian filter and median filter 
  - edge detector (sobel mask, Roberts Mask, Prewitt, Canny edge detectors)
  - function to draw histogram and distribution curve
  - image equlization using histogram equalization 
  - image normalization 
  - local and global thresholding 
  - transormation from color image to grey scale image and plot R,G,B histograms with its distribution function 
  - frequency domain filter 
  - hybrid images 
  - hough transform implementation to detect lines and circles in images 
  - Active contour model (snake) using greedy algorithm.
